Pizza (Italian: [pittsa], Neapolitan: ['pittse]) is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. [1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.
